# voltageluaexecutor
a poor lua executor for 32-bit gmod.
compile on vs code 2019 v142 with installed directx june 2010.
this "implementation" can and will crash because of the thing i like to call "multithreading badness". working on a better one right now. to avoid - use gmod_mcore_test 0 in your game console.
