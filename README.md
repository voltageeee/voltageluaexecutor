# voltageluaexecutor
a shitty lua executor for 32-bit gmod.
compile on vs code 2019 v142 with installed directx june 2010.
this "implementation" can and will crash. working on a better one right now. to avoid - use gmod_mcore_test 0 in your game console. the reason is that i'm trying to push your lua code into a stack from a different thread and, well, lua stack underflow. cry me a river.
